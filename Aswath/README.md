<b>Tasklist</b>
- [x] Clean the training subset of the data and perform various data cleaning techniques (Impute with statistical Measures - Mean)
- [x] Generate a Linear Regression Modal from the training subset. (Used LinearRegression class Object from sci-kit to generate the modal)  
- [x] Predict the outcomes for the testing subset with the generated modal. (Used the same object and modal generated above to fit the outcomes of the testing subset)
- [x] Measure accuracy (F-Measure) and compare with other modal within this repository (Summarized the data using Ordinary Least Squares and got the score/F-Measure value)
- [x] Generate and Visualize the outcomes of the prediction above (Generated and visualized the various features of the dataset in different aspects to analyze and get inferences)
- [] Analyze and give inferences from the predictions and visualization (In-Progress)
